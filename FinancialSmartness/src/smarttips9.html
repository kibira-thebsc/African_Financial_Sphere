            <h5>The tax structure in India is divided into <b>direct</b> and <b>indirect taxes</b>. </h5>
            <p>While direct taxes are levied on taxable income earned by individuals and corporate entities, the burden
                to deposit taxes is on the assessees themselves. On the other hand, indirect taxes are levied on the
                sale and provision of goods and services respectively and the burden to collect and deposit taxes is on
                the sellers instead of the assessees directly.
                The taxation system in India is such that the taxes are levied by the Central Government and the State
                Governments. Some minor taxes are also levied by the local authorities such as the Municipality and the
                Local Governments.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Examples of Direct Taxes</h4>
            </p>
            <h6>These are some of the direct taxes that you pay</h6>
            <p>
            <h5>a) Income Tax:</h5>
            This is one of the most well-known and least understood taxes. It is the tax that is levied on your earning
            in a financial year. There are many facets to income tax, such as the tax slabs, taxable income, tax
            deducted at source (TDS), reduction of taxable income, etc. The tax is applicable to both individuals and
            companies. For individuals, the tax that they have to pay depends on which tax bracket they fall in. This
            bracket or slab determines the tax to be paid based on the annual income of the assessee and ranges from no
            tax to 30% tax for the high income groups.</p>
            <p>The government has fixed different taxes slabs for varied groups of individuals, namely general
                taxpayers, senior citizens (people aged between 60 to 80, and very senior citizens (people aged above
                80).</p>
            <p>
            <h5>b) Capital Gains Tax:</h5>
            This is a tax that is payable whenever you receive a sizable amount of money. It could be from an investment
            or from the sale of a property. It is usually of two types, short term capital gains from investments held
            for less than 36 months and long term capital gains from investments held for longer than 36 months. The
            interest thing about this tax is that the gain doesn’t always have to be in the form of money. It could also
            be an exchange in kind in which case the value of the exchange will be considered for taxation.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>c) Securities Transaction Tax:</h5>
            It’s no secret that if you know how to trade properly on the stock market, and trade in securities, you
            stand to make a substantial amount of money. This too is a source of income but it has its own tax which is
            known as the Securities Transaction Tax .This means that every time you buy or sell shares, you pay this
            tax. All securities traded on the Indian stock exchange have this tax attached to them.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>d) Perquisite Tax:</h5>
            Perquisites are all the perks or privileges that employers may extend to employees. These privileges may
            include a house provided by the company or a car for your use, given to you by the company. this tax is
            levied is by figuring out how that perk has been acquired by the company or used by the employee. In the
            case of cars, it may be so that a car provided by the company and used for both personal and official
            purposes is eligible for tax whereas a car used only for official purposes is not.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>e) Corporate Tax:</h5>
            Corporate tax is the income tax that is paid by companies from the revenue they earn. This tax also comes
            with a slab of its own that decides how much tax the company has to pay. For example a domestic company,
            which has a revenue of less than Rs. 1 crore per annum, won’t have to pay this tax but one that has a
            revenue of more than Rs. 1 crore per annum will have to pay this tax.
            There are four different types of corporate tax. They are:</p>
            <p>
            <h6>• Minimum Alternative Tax:</h6>
            Minimum Alternative Tax, or MAT, is basically a way for the Income Tax Department to get companies to pay a
            minimum tax, which currently stands at 18.5%. This form of tax was brought into effect through the
            introduction of Section 115JA of the Income Tax Act. However, companies involved in infrastructure and power
            sectors are exempt from paying MAT.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h6>• Fringe Benefit Tax:</h6>
            Fringe Benefit Tax, or FBT, was a tax which applied to almost every fringe benefit an employer provided to
            their employees. In this tax, a number of aspects were covered. Some of them include:</p>
            <p>
            <h6>i) Employer’s expense on travel (LTA), employee welfare, accommodation, and entertainment.</h6>
            <h6>ii) Any regular commute or commute related expense provided by an employer.</h6>
            <h6>iii) Employer’s contribution to a certified retirement fund.</h6>
            <h6>iv) Employer Stock Option Plans (ESOPs).</h6>
            FBT was started under the Indian government’s stewardship from April 1, 2005. However, the tax was later
            scrapped in 2009 by the-then Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee during the 2009 Union Budget session.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>• Dividend Distribution Tax:</h6>
            Dividend Distribution Tax was introduced after the end of 2007’s Union Budget. It is basically a tax levied
            on companies based on the dividend they pay to their investors. Currently, the DDT rate stands at 15%.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>• Banking Cash Transaction Tax:</h6>
            Banking Cash Transaction Tax is yet another form of tax that has been abandoned by the Indian government.
            This form of taxation was operation from 2005-2009 until the then FM Pranab Mukherjee nullified the tax.
            This tax suggested that every bank transaction (debit or credit) would be taxed at a rate of 0.1%.</p>

            <h4>2. Indirect Tax:</h4>
            <p>By definition, indirect taxes are those taxes that are levied on goods or services. They differ from
                direct taxes because they are not levied on a person who pays them directly to the government, they are
                instead levied on products and are collected by an intermediary, the person selling the product. The
                most common examples of indirect tax Indirect tax can be VAT (Value Added Tax), Taxes on Imported Goods,
                Sales Tax, etc. These taxes are levied by adding them to the price of the service or product which tends
                to push the cost of the product up.</p>
            <h5>Examples of Indirect Taxes:</h5>
            <p>These are some of the common indirect taxes that you pay.
            <h5>a) Sales Tax:</h5>
            </p>
            <p>As the name suggests, sales tax is a tax that is levied on the sale of a product. This product can be
                something that was produced in India or imported and can even cover services rendered. This tax is
                levied on the seller of the product who then transfers it onto the person who buys said product with the
                sales tax added to the price of the product. The limitation of this tax is that it can be levied only
                ones for a particular product, which means that if the product is sold a second time, sales tax cannot
                be applied to it.</p>
            <p> Also, this tax is levied under both central and state legislations.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>b) Service Tax:</h5>
            Like sales tax is added to the price of goods sold in India, so is service tax added to services provided in
            India. In the reading of the budget 2015, it was announced that the service tax will be raised from 12.36%
            to 14%. It is not applicable on goods but on companies that provide services and is collected every month or
            once every quarter based on how the services are provided. If the establishment is an individual service
            provider then the service tax is paid only once the customer pays the bills however, for companies the
            service tax is payable the moment the invoice is raised, irrespective of the customer paying the bill.</p>
            <p>An important thing to remember is that since the service at a restaurant is a combination of the food,
                the waiter and the premises themselves, it is difficult to pin point what qualifies for service tax. To
                remove any ambiguity, in this regard, it has been announced that the service tax in restaurants will be
                levied only on 40% of the total bill.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>• GST - Goods and Service Tax:</h5>
            The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is the largest reform in India’s indirect tax structure since the market
            started opening up about 25 years ago. The GST is a consumption-based tax, as it is applicable where
            consumption takes place. The GST is levied on value-added goods and services at each stage of consumption in
            the supply chain. The GST payable on the procurement of goods and services can be set off against the GST
            payable on the supply of goods and services, the merchant will pay the applicable GST rate but can claim it
            back through the tax credit mechanism.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>c) Value Added Tax:</h5>
            VAT, also known as commercial tax is not applicable on commodities that are zero rated (eg. food and
            essential drugs) or those that fall under exports. This tax is levied at all the stages of the supply chain,
            right from the manufacturers, dealers and distributors to the end user.</p> For Schedule 3 the VAT is 1%,
            for schedule 2 the VAT is 5% and so on. Goods that have not been classified into any category have a VAT of
            15%.
            <p>
            <h5>d) Custom duty & Octroi:</h5>
            When you purchase anything that needs to be imported from another country, a charge is applied on it and
            that is the customs duty. It applies to all the products that come in via land, sea or air. Even if you
            bring in products bought in another country to India, a customs duty can be levied on it. The purpose of the
            customs duty is to ensure that all the goods entering the country are taxed and paid for.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>e) Excise Duty:</h5>
            This is a tax that is levied on all the goods manufactured or produced in India. It is different from
            customs duty because it is applicable only on things produced in India and is also known as the Central
            Value Added Tax or CENVAT. This tax is collected by the government from the manufacturer of the goods. It
            can also be collected from those entities that receive manufactured goods and employ people to transport the
            goods from the manufacturer to themselves.</p>
            <p>The Central Excise Rule set by the central government provide suggest that every person that produces or
                manufactures any 'excisable goods', or who stores such goods in a warehouse, will have to pay the duty
                applicable on such goods in. Under this rule no excisable goods, on which any duty is payable, will be
                allowed to move without payment of duty from any place, where they are produced or manufactured.</p>

            <h5>Other Taxes:</h5>
            <p>While direct and indirect taxes are the two main types of taxes, there are also these small cess taxes
                that are also seen in the country. Although, they aren’t major revenue generators and are not considered
                to be as such, these taxes help the government fund several initiatives that concentrate on the
                improving the basic infrastructure and maintain general well being of the country. The taxes in this
                category are primarily referred to as a cess, which are taxes levied by the government and the funds
                generated through this are used for specific purposes as per the Finance Minister’s discretions.</p>
            <p>
            <h5>Examples of Other taxes:</h5>
            Below are some of the examples of other taxes that are seen most commonly in India.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>a) Professional Tax:</h6>
            Professional Tax, or employment tax, is another form of tax levied only by state governments in India.
            According to professional tax norms, individuals earning income or practicing a profession such as a doctor,
            lawyer, chartered accountant, or company secretary etc. are required to pay this tax. However, not all
            states levy professional tax and the rate differs across all the states that levy the tax.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>b) Property Tax - Municipal Tax:</h6>
            Also known as Property Tax or Real Estate Tax, this is one of the taxes levied by local municipal bodies of
            every city. These taxes are levied in order to provide and maintain the for basic civic services. All owners
            of residential or commercial properties are subject to Municipal Tax.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>c) Entertainment Tax:</h6>
            Entertainment Tax is yet another type of tax commonly seen in India. It is levied by the government on
            feature films, television series, exhibitions, amusement, and recreational parlours. This tax is collected
            taking into account a business entity’s gross collection collected from earnings based on commercial shows,
            film festival earnings, and audience participation.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>d) Stamp Duty, Registration Fees, Transfer Tax:</h6>
            Stamp duty, registration fees, and transfer taxes are collect as a supplement of property tax. For instance,
            when an individual purchases a property, they also have to pay for the cost of stamps (stamp duty),
            registration fees (fee charged by local registrar to legalize a property transaction), and transfer tax (tax
            paid to transfer the ownership of a commodity.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>>e) Education Cess/Surcharge:</h6>
            Education cess is a tax in India primarily introduced to help cover the cost of government-sponsored
            educational programs. This tax is collected independently of other taxes and is applicable to all Indian
            citizens, corporations, and other people living in the country. The effective rate of education cess
            currently stands at 2% of an individual’s income.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>f) Gift Tax:</h6>
            When an individual receives a gift from another person. It is considered to be a part of their income
            generated through “other sources” and the relevant tax is levied. This tax is applicable if the gift amount
            is more than Rs. 50,000 in a year.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>g) Wealth Tax:</h6>
            Wealth Tax was another tax levied by the government, which was charged based on the net wealth of the
            assessee. Wealth tax is chargeable with respect to the net wealth of a property. Net wealth is equal to all
            the assets an individual owns minus the cost of acquiring them (any loan taken to acquire them). Wealth tax
            is no longer operational as it was abolished during the Union Budget of 2015.</p>
            <p>The wealth tax, governed by the Wealth Tax Act, allows the government to impose a tax on the net wealth
                of a person, an HUF or a company. This tax is set to be abolished in 2016 but until then the tax levied
                on the net wealth is about 1% of the wealth that exceeds Rs. 30 lakhs. There are exceptions to this tax
                which are organisations that don’t have to pay wealth tax. These organisations could be trusts,
                partnership firms, social clubs, political parties, etc.</p>
            <p>
            <h6>h) Toll Tax & Road Tax:</h6>
            Toll tax is a tax you often pay to use any form of infrastructure developed by the government, example roads
            and bridges. The tax amount levied is rather negligible which is used for maintenance and basic upkeep of a
            particular project.</p>
            <h6>i) Swachh Bharat Cess:</h6>
            <p>This is a cess imposed by the government of India and was started from 15 November 2015. This tax is
                applicable on all taxable services and the cess currently stands at 0.5%. Swachh Bharat cess is levied
                over and above the 14% service tax that is prevalent in the present times. One thing worth noting here
                is that this cess is not applicable on services that are fully exempt of service tax or those services
                covered under the negative list of services. It is collected by the Consolidate Fund of India and will
                be used to funding and promoting any government campaigns concerning the Swachh Bharat initiatives. This
                tax, however, is independent of service tax and is charged as a separate line item in invoices.</p>
