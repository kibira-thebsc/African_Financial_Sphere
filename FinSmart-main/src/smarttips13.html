            <br>
            <h4>Personal Financial Crises </h4>
            <p>Personal financial crises result from unexpected events like a medical emergency, or they can just result
                from poor financial planning. Either way, they will wreak havoc with your budget and spiral you into
                debt.The thought of being hit with a major negative event that could affect your finances, such as a job
                loss, an illness, a car accident—or a pandemic—can keep anyone awake at night. However, the prospect of
                something expensive and beyond your control happening becomes less threatening if you’re properly
                prepared. Here are 10 steps for how to deal with an economic crisis.

            </p>

            <p>
            <h4>1. Maximize Your Liquid Savings</h4>
            Cash accounts, such as checking, savings, and money market accounts—as well as certificates of deposit (CD)
            and short-term government investments—will help you the most in a crisis. You’ll want to turn to these
            resources first because their value doesn’t fluctuate with market conditions, unlike stocks, index funds,
            exchange traded funds (ETFs), and other financial instruments in which you might have invested.</p>

            <p>This means you can take your money out at any time without incurring a financial loss. Also, unlike
                retirement accounts, you won’t face early withdrawal penalties or incur tax penalties when you withdraw
                your money, except for CDs, which usually require you to forfeit some of the interest you’ve earned if
                you close them early.</p>

            <p>Don’t invest in stocks or other higher-risk investments until you have several months’ worth of cash in
                liquid accounts. How many months’ worth of cash do you need? It depends on your financial obligations
                and risk tolerance.</p>

            <p>If you have a major obligation, such as a mortgage or a child’s ongoing tuition payments, you might want
                to have more months’ worth of expenses saved up than if you’re single and renting an apartment. A
                three-month expense cushion is considered a bare minimum, but some folks like to keep six months or even
                up to two years’ worth of expenses in liquid savings to guard against a long bout of unemployment.</p>



            <h4>2. Make a Budget</h4>
            <p>If you don’t know exactly how much money you have coming in and going out each month, you won’t know how
                much money you need for your emergency fund. And if you aren’t keeping a budget, you also have no idea
                whether you’re currently living below your means or overextending yourself. A budget is not a parent—it
                can’t and won’t force you to change your behavior—but it is a useful tool that can help you decide if
                you’re happy with where your money is going and where you stand financially.</p>
            <h4>3. Prepare to Minimize Your Monthly Bills</h4>
            <p>
                You might not have to do it now, but be ready to start cutting out anything that is not a necessity. If
                you can get your recurring monthly expenses as low as they can be, you’ll have less difficulty paying
                your bills when money is tight.Maybe you're in the habit of letting the heater or air conditioner run
                when you’re not home or leaving lights on in rooms you aren’t using. You may be able to trim your
                utility bills. Now might also be a good time to shop around for lower insurance rates and find out if
                you can cancel certain types of insurance, such as car insurance, in the event of an emergency. Some
                insurance companies might give you an extension, so look for the steps involved and be prepared.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>4. Closely Manage Your Bills</h4>
            There’s no reason to waste money on late fees or finance charges, yet families do it all the time. During a
            job loss crisis, you should be extra studious in this area. Simply being organized can save you a lot of
            money when it comes to your monthly bills.Set a date twice a month to review all your accounts, so you don’t
            miss any due dates. Schedule electronic payments or mail checks so that your payment arrives several days
            before it’s due. This way, if a delay occurs, your payment will probably still arrive on time. If you’re
            having trouble keeping track of all your accounts, start compiling a list. When your list is complete, you
            can use it to make sure you’re on top of all your accounts and to see if there are any you can combine or
            close.


            </p>
            <h4>5. Take Stock of Your Non-Cash Assets and Maximize Their Value</h4>
            <p>Being prepared might include identifying all of your options. Do you have frequent flyer miles you can
                use if you need to travel? Do you have extra food in your house that you can plan meals around to lower
                your grocery bills? Do you have any gift cards you can put toward entertainment or sell for cash? Do you
                have rewards from a credit card that you can convert to gift cards? All these assets can help you lower
                your monthly expenses, but only if you know what you have and use it wisely. Knowing what you have can
                also prevent you from buying things you don’t need.</p>
            <p>
            <h4>6. Pay Down Your Credit Card Debt</h4>
            If you have credit card debt, the interest charges you’re paying every month probably take up a significant
            portion of your monthly budget. If you make it a point to pay down your credit card debt, you will reduce
            your monthly financial obligations and put yourself in a position to start building a better nest egg.
            Getting rid of interest payments frees you to put your money toward more important things.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>7. Get a Better Credit Card Deal</h4>
            If you’re currently carrying a balance, it could really help you to transfer that balance to another card
            with a lower rate. Paying less interest means that you can pay off your total debt faster and/or gain some
            breathing room in your monthly budget. Just make sure that what you save from the lower interest rate is
            greater than the balance transfer fee. If you’re transferring your balance to a new card with a low
            introductory annual percentage rate (APR), aim to pay off your balance during the introductory period,
            before your rate goes up.


            </p>
            <h4>8. Look for Ways to Earn Extra Cash</h4>
            <p>Everyone has something they can do to earn extra money, whether it’s selling possessions you no longer
                use (either online or in a garage sale), babysitting, chasing credit card and bank account opening
                bonuses, freelancing, or getting a second job. The money you earn from these activities may seem
                insignificant compared to what you earn at your primary job, but even small amounts can add up to
                something meaningful over time. Besides, many of these activities have side benefits: You might end up
                with a less cluttered house or discover that you enjoy your side job enough to make it your career.

            </p>
            <h4>9. Check Your Insurance Coverage
            </h4>
            <p>In step three we recommended shopping around for lower insurance rates. If you’re carrying too much
                insurance—or could be getting the same coverage from another provider for a better price—these are
                obvious changes you can make to lower your monthly bills.</p>
            <h4>10. Keep Up With Routine Maintenance</h4>
            <p>If you keep the components of your car, home, and physical health in top condition, you can catch
                problems while they’re small and avoid expensive repairs and medical bills later. It’s cheaper to have a
                cavity filled than to get a root canal, easier to replace a couple of pieces of wood than to have your
                house tented for termites, and better to eat healthy and exercise than end up needing expensive
                treatments for diabetes or heart disease. You might think you don’t have the time or money to deal with
                these things on a regular basis, but they can create much larger disruptions of your time and finances
                if you ignore them.
