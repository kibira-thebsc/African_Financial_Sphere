            <h4>The Effects Of Inflation On Your Savings </h4>
            <p>Inflation affects specific aspects of one’s personal finances differently. One area that is perhaps most
                susceptible to inflation are cash investments like a savings account. Because money is readily
                accessible, some people prefer to keep it in a savings account rather than invest it. Yet, as time
                passes, the value of money kept in a savings account can lose its value, considering that prices
                generally increase in the future.
            <p>In essence, inflation will eat away at one’s purchasing power, because not only will the money lose
                value, it won’t gain anything either. This can be a cause for concern during retirement when you have
                less earning power. To protect the purchasing power of your savings from the rate of inflation, it would
                have to grow at or beyond the inflation rate. An effectual way to beat the effects of inflation on your
                savings is to invest some of those savings in the stock market.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>The Impact Of Inflation On Stocks</h4>
            <p> Investing money in the stock market inevitably comes with a higher level of risk than simply keeping
                money in a savings account. Yet, as time passes, the stock market is expected to be able to handle or
                exceed the rate of inflation. Because of this fact, some investors prefer to invest their money in
                potentially higher growth investments like stocks. For those who prefer to avoid the volatility of
                individual stocks, another option is mutual funds, which usually provide good returns and are
                professionally managed. Furthermore, index funds might be an even better alternative for some, as they
                aren’t reliant on a fund manager, and follow their benchmark financial market index.
            <p>However, apropos of stocks, inflation still affects the value of the investment. The value of a stock is
                dependent on the performance of a company. When the economy is strong, inflation is usually high. During
                these periods, a company may have increased revenue and earnings, which would help their share price.
                However, as inflation rises, the company would have a larger expenditure for things like wages or raw
                materials – thus, affecting the company’s value. Additionally, akin to any other return, the stock’s
                return value will decrease as purchasing power decreases over time.</p>
            </p>
            <h4>The Effects Of Inflation On Bonds And Treasury Bills</h4>
            <p> Debt securities like bonds and Treasury bills are fixed-income assets that payout the same amount each
                year. These assets are not as affected by inflation as money in a savings account. However, when the
                rate of inflation increases faster than the return on debt securities, their value depreciates. Earnings
                diminish as purchasing power declines with the rate of inflation.
                One option, especially for those in their retirement years, is Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
                (also referred to as TIPS). These forms of inflation-protected bonds are indexed to inflation, therefore
                protecting investors from the adverse effects of increased prices.
            </p>
            <h4>Property Ownership And Inflation</h4>
            <p> Property ownership is perhaps the most beneficial during periods of high inflation. As inflation
                increases, so does the value of the property. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage on a property, then the
                cost of the monthly mortgage payments will decrease as time passes.
                However, because most people purchase properties with mortgages, higher interest rates could dissuade
                people from increasing their debt-load. Therefore, the demand for property decreases, making it more
                difficult to resell.
