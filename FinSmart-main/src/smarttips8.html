            <h4>1. Avoid the herd mentality </h4>
            <p>The typical buyer's decision is usually heavily influenced by the actions of his acquaintances,
                neighbours or relatives. Thus, if everybody around is investing in a particular stock, the tendency for
                potential investors is to do the same. But this strategy is bound to backfire in the long run.
                No need to say that you should always avoid having the herd mentality if you don't want to lose your
                hard-earned money in stock markets
                .</p>
            <h4>2. Take informed decision </h4>
            <p>Proper research should always be undertaken before investing in stocks. But that is rarely done.
                Investors generally go by the name of a company or the industry they belong to. This is, however, not
                the right way of putting one's money into the stock market.
                .</p>
            <h4>3. Invest in business you understand</h4>
            <p>Never invest in a stock. Invest in a business instead. And invest in a business you understand. In other
                words, before investing in a company, you should know what business the company is in.</p>

            <h4>4. Don't try to time the market</h4>
            <p>One thing that even Warren Buffett doesn't do is to try to time the stock market, although he does have a
                very strong view on the price levels appropriate to individual shares. A majority of investors, however,
                do just the opposite, something that financial planners have always been warning them to avoid, and thus
                lose their hard-earned money in the process.</p>
            <h4>5. Follow a disciplined investment approach</h4>
            <p>Historically it has been witnessed that even great bull runs have shown bouts of panic moments. The
                volatility witnessed in the markets has inevitably made investors lose money despite the great bull
                runs.

                However, the investors who put in money systematically, in the right shares and held on to their
                investments patiently have been seen generating outstanding returns
            </p>
            <h4>6. Do not let emotions cloud your judgement</h4>
            <p>Many investors have been losing money in stock markets due to their inability to control emotions,
                particularly fear and greed. In a bull market, the lure of quick wealth is difficult to resist. Greed
                augments when investors hear stories of fabulous returns being made in the stock market in a short
                period of time.
                In a bear market, on the other hand, investors panic and sell their shares at rock-bottom prices. Thus,
                fear and greed are the worst emotions to feel when investing, and it is better not to be guided by them.
            </p>
            <h4>7. Create a broad portfolio</h4>
            <p>Diversification of portfolio across asset classes and instruments is the key factor to earn optimum
                returns on investments with minimum risk. Level of diversification depends on each investor's risk
                taking capacity</p>
            <h4>8. Have realistic expectations</h4>
            <p>There's nothing wrong with hoping for the 'best' from your investments, but you could be heading for
                trouble if your financial goals are based on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, lots of stocks have
                generated more than 50 per cent returns during the great bull run of recent years.

                However, it doesn't mean that you should always expect the same kind of return from the stock markets.
            </p>
            <h4>9. Invest only your surplus funds</h4>
            <p>If you want to take risk in a volatile market like this, then see whether you have surplus funds which
                you can afford to lose. It is not necessary that you will lose money in the present scenario. You
                investments can give you huge gains too in the months to come.

                But no one can be hundred percent sure. That is why you will have to take risk. No need to say that
                invest only if you are flush with surplus funds.
            </p>
            <h4>10. Monitor rigorously</h4>
            <p>We are living in a global village. Any important event happening in any part of the world has an impact
                on our financial markets. Hence we need to constantly monitor our portfolio and keep affecting the
                desired changes in it.

                If you can't review your portfolio due to time constraint or lack of knowledge, then you should take the
                help of a good financial planner or someone who is capable of doing that.
