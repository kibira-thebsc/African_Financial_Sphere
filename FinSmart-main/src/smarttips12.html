            <h4>Investments </h4>
            <p>Investments are important because in today’s world, just earning money is not enough. You work hard for
                the money you earn. But that may not be adequate for you to lead a comfortable lifestyle or fulfill your
                dreams and goals. To do that, you need to make your money work hard for you as well. This is why you
                invest.</p>
            <p>
            <h4>How should you plan your investments</h4>
            </p>
            <p> first step in planning your investment that fits your profile and needs. Here are a few things to keep
                in mind when planning your investments:
            <h6>1.Choose investments carefully after doing adequate research</h6>
            <h6>2.Don’t fall for quick-buck schemes that promise high returns in a short time</h6>
            <h6>3.Review your stock and mutual fund investments periodically</h6>
            <h6>4.Consider the tax implications on returns you earn from your investments</h6>
            </p>

            <h4>7 steps to invest in share market in India for beginners</h4>
            Let’s see a step by step guide on how to invest in the share market in India
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Step 1. Screening and Filtering the right stocks using Financials</h4>There are thousands of stocks
            listed on BSE and NSE and it’s almost impossible to investigate each and every one of them by going through
            their entire financial information
            <div>
                <h6>Market Cap > Rs 500 cr</h6>
                <h6>Sales and Profit growth >10%</h6>
                <h6> Earnings Per Share(EPS) growth rate is increasing for the past 5 years</h6>
                <h6>Debt to Equity Ratio <1 </h6>
                        <h6>Return on Equity(RoE) >20%</h6>
                        <h6>Price to Book value(P/B) <= or low compared to peer companies within the same industry</h6>
                                <h6> Price to Earnings(P/E) < 25 or low compared to peer companies within the same
                                        industry</h6>
                                        <h6>Current ratio >1 </h6>
            </div>
            Therefore, for your initial consideration, you can use the below easy to implement screening criteria to
            filter out those stocks whose fundamentals look strong.
            You don’t have to scratch your head to get the above financial information. Online screener tools available
            on financial platforms like Moneycontrol and EquityMaster provide this information readily.

            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Step 2. Select only the companies that you understand</h4>
            Now that based on Step 1 you have filtered out stocks with good fundamentals from rest of the garbage, learn
            more about these stocks by reading about the underlying company as much as you can.</p>
            <p>
                You can do this by visiting the website of the company, tracking updates on media platforms, searching
                for the company on Google, and getting peer feedback from fellow investors.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3. Look for companies with sustainable Moat (competitive advantage) </h4>
            <p>It’s not enough that you identify companies that have passed the test of financial numbers and whose
                business models are easy to understand.It is equally important to analyze the company from a qualitative
                aspect –<b> Moat</b>.In business terminology, Moat is the competitive advantage that one company has
                over the other within the same industry. The wider the moat, the larger the competitive advantage of the
                company and more sustainable the company becomes.
            </p>
            <p>Which means, it would be very difficult for the competitors to displace that company and capture its
                market share.
                Examples of this Moat can be brand power, intellectual property rights and patents, network effects,
                govt. regulations controlling barriers to entry, and many more.For example – Apple has a strong brand
                name, pricing power, patents, and huge market demand that give it a wide moat which acts as barriers
                against other companies.
                No wonder that Apple is close to becoming a trillion-dollar company and has generated huge profits year
                after year, making great returns for its investors.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Step 4. Find Low Debt Levels</h4>
            Large debt levels pose a significant risk to the company. Couple of screening criteria which we used to
            filter the stocks were Debt to Equity Ratio and Current Ratio.
            These two ratios are indicators of how heavily is company dependent on borrowed capital(debt) to fund its
            growth and whether the company will be able to meet its short-term capital obligations.
            So when you are selecting stocks, apart from these ratios, check out how the company is handling its debt
            over the past many years. The company that is reducing its debt will automatically increase its profits
            which is a positive sign for the financial health of the company.

            </p>
            <h4>Step 5. Use financial ratios RoE and RoCE to identify the right stocks</h4>
            <p>Warren Buffett makes use of these two financial ratios RoE(Return on Equity) and RoCE(Return of Capital
                Employed) to aid him in selecting the right stocks.
                RoE is the percentage expression of a company’s net income as it is returned as a value to shareholders.
                This formula allows investors as an alternative measure of the company’s profitability and calculates
                the efficiency with which a company generates profit using the funds that shareholders have invested.
                RoCE is the primary measure of how efficiently a company utilizes all available capital to generate
                additional profits.
            </p>
            <p>
            <h4>Step 6. Honest, Transparent, and Competent Management</h4>
            Fraud management is one of the reasons some people do not trust the stock market with their savings. There
            have been many cases in the past where management of listed companies did shady deals, committed accounting
            frauds, misled shareholders & SEBI, causing a lot of monetary loss to investors.A famous example being
            Ramalinga Raju of Satyam.
