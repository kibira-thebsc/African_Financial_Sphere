            <p>A loan is when money is given to another party in exchange for repayment of the loan principal amount
                plus interest.</p>
            <h4>Types of Loan</h4>
            <p>There are various types of loans available in India, and they are classified based on two factors:
            <p> 1.Whether they require collateral.</p>
            <p> 2.The purpose they are used for.</p>
            <p> Based on whether they require collateral, loans are classified into secured loans and unsecured loans.
                Let’s take a look at each type.
            </p>
            <h4>Secured loans </h4>
            <p> These are loans that do require collateral, i.e., you have to provide an asset to the lender as security
                for the money you are borrowing. That way, if you are unable to repay the loan, the lender still has
                some means to get back their money. The rate of interest of secured loans tends to be lower as compared
                to those for loans without collateral.</p>
            <h4>Types of secured loans</h4>
            <h4>1. Home loan</h4>
            <p>
                Home loans are a secured mode of finance, that give you the funds to buy or build the home of your
                choice. The following are the type of home loans available in India:

            <p><b>Land purchase loan</b>:
                Purchase land for your new home</p>
            <p> <b> Home construction loan </b>:
                Build a new home</p>
            <p><b>Home loan balance transfer</b>:
                Transfer the balance of your existing home loan at a lower interest rate</p>
            <p><b>Top up loan</b>:
                Can be used to renovate an existing home or have the latest interiors for your new home

            </p>
            <h4>2. Loan against property (LAP)</h4>
            <p>
                Loan against property is one of the most common forms of a secured loan where you can pledge any
                residential, commercial or industrial property for availing the funds required. The loan amount
                disbursed is equivalent to a certain percentage of the property’s value and varies across lenders.
            </p>
            <p>
                While some lenders may offer an amount equivalent to 50-60% of the property’s value, others may offer an
                amount close to 80%. A loan against property helps you unlock the dormant value of your asset and can be
                used to satiate personal life goals such as higher education of children or marriage. Businesses use a
                loan against property for business expansion, R&D and product development among others.
            </p>
            <h4>3. Loans against insurance policies </h4>
            <p>Yes, you can also avail loans against your insurance policy. However, note that all insurance policies
                don’t qualify for this. Only policies, such as endowment and money-back policies, which have a maturity
                value can be used to avail loans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, you can’t avail a loan against a term insurance plan as it doesn’t have any maturity benefits.
                Also, loans can’t be availed against unit-linked plans as the returns aren’t fixed and depends on the
                performance of the market. It’s essential to note that you can opt for a loan against endowment and
                money back policies only after they’ve acquired a surrender value. These policies acquire a surrender
                value only after paying regular premiums continuously for 3 years.
            </p>
            <h4>4. Gold loans</h4>
            <p>For the longest time, gold has been one of the most favoured asset classes. The organized Indian gold
                loan industry is expected to touch Rs.3,101 billion by 2019-20, according to a KPMG report, thanks to
                flexible interest rates offered by financial institutions.

            </p>
            <p>
                A gold loan requires you to pledge gold jewellery or coins as collateral. The loan amount sanctioned is
                a certain percentage of the gold’s value pledged. Gold loans are generally used for short-term needs and
                have a short repayment tenor compared to home loans and loan against property.
            </p>
            <h4>5. Loans against mutual funds and shares </h4>
            <p>An ideal vehicle for long-term wealth creation, mutual funds can also be pledged as collateral for a
                loan. You can pledge equity or hybrid funds to the financial institution for availing a loan. For doing
                so, you need to write to your financier and execute a loan agreement.
            </p>
            <h4>6. Loans against fixed deposits</h4>
            <p>The humble fixed deposit not only offers assured returns but can also come handy when you need a loan.
                The amount of loan can vary between 70-90% of the FD’s value and varies across lenders. However, it’s
                essential to note that the loan tenor can’t be more than the FD’s tenor.
            </p>
            <h4>II. Unsecured loans</h4>
            <p>
                These are loans that do not require collateral. The lender lends you the money based on past
                associations, and your credit score and history. Thus, you have to have a good credit history to avail
                these loans. Unsecured loans usually come at a higher rate of interest due to the lack of collateral.
            </p>
            <h4>Types of unsecured loan</h4>
            <h4>1. Personal loan</h4>
            <p>Offering an instant flush of liquidity, a personal loan is one of the most popular types of unsecured
                loans. However, since a personal loan is an unsecured mode of finance, the interest rates are higher
                compared to secured loans. A good credit score along with high and stable income ensures you can avail
                this loan at a competitive rate of interest. Personal loans can be used for the following purposes-</p>

                only on the amount used. You can withdraw on your loan limit, any number of times and prepay when you

            <p> Based on what they are used for, loans are classified mainly into:</p>
            <h5>1. Education loans</h5>
            <p>Aspiration for higher education from reputed institutions have bolstered the demand for education loans
                in the country. This loan covers the basic fees of the course along with allied expenses such as the
                accommodation, exam fee, etc. In this loan, the student is the main borrower while parents, siblings and
                spouse are co-applicants.An education loan can be taken for a full-time, part-time or vocational course
                along with graduation and post-graduation course in the fields of management, engineering and medicine,

            <h5>2. Vehicle loans</h5>
            <p>
                A vehicle loan is extended in the form of a two or four-wheeler loan which helps you to buy your dream
                vehicle. Vehicle loans are offered either on purchase of a new vehicle or a used one. Your credit score,
                ratio of debt to income, loan tenor, etc., play a crucial role in determining the loan amount.
